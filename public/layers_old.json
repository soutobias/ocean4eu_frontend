Also Satellite Derived Bathymetry data products have been included fro Landsat 8 and Sentinel satellite images. Areas not covered by observations are completed by integrating GEBCO 2022 and IBCAO V4.\n Source: https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/geonetwork/emodnet/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/ff3aff8a-cff1-44a3-a2c8-1910bf109f85",

Notification of an SSSI under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 has since been amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2001, which brought about numerous changes in the way SSSI are notified managed and protected. In order to ensure consistent, favourable long-term management of these sites, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) with landowners have prepared management plans for all SSSI in Wales. Local planning authorities are required to consult NRW before allowing any development to proceed that may affect an SSSI. Water, gas and electricity companies must also do the same.

The model includes the sublittoral zone only; due to the high variability of the littoral zone, a lack of detailed substrate data and the resolution of the model, it is difficult to predict littoral habitats at this scale. \nEUSeaMap is classified into EUNIS 2019 level 3 (or more detailed levels where appropriate), EUNIS 2019 level 2 , EUNIS 2007-2011, the MSFD benthic broad habitat types, the HELCOM HUB classification in the Baltic, and the recently revised habitat classification in the Mediterranean. In the Black Sea, EUSeaMap is not classified into EUNIS 2007-2011 (due to inapplicability), but is classified according to a classification that was developed by EMODnet Seabed Habitats (Populus et a, 2017, and for a revised version Vasquez et al, 2020, See Online resources). \nReports that provide methods used for the classification of the predicted habitats into the new 2019 EUNIS classification, regional classifications, and MSFD BBHT (v.2017) are linked in Online Resources. \nA report on the methods used in the 2021 version of EUSeaMap (Vasquez et al., 2021) and reports on previous versions (v2016 and V2019) are linked in Online Resources.",
